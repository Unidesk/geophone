        <h2>Geophone API server</h2>
        <p>Geophone is a very simple API server that delivers the LibPhoneAPI library via a REST interface, created and hosted by
            Unidesk Corporation (<a href="http://www.unidesk.com">www.unidesk.com</a>).  This is a private API server, but
            the source code is published on GitHub at <a href="http://www.github.com/Unidesk/geophone">Unidesk/geophone</a> if
            you wish to host your own server.</p>
        <p>To use GeoPhone, the API end-point is /geophone/API?key=XYZ where XYZ is a license key according to the
            license key file keys.xml.</p>
        <h3><b>APIs</b></h3>
        <ul><li>/geophone/lookup?phone=XXXXXXXX&key=XYZ</li>
        <li>/geophone/batch&key=XYZ</li>
        </ul>
